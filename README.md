# Azure Nanodegree Capstone Project: Breast Cancer Prediction

This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree. In this project, I have used https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset Breast Cancer dataset.

The objective is to train a machine learning model using Hyperdrive and AutoML and predict mortality caused by heart failure. Models from these two experiments are compared using Accuracy score, best model is registered and deployed to Azure Container Service as a REST endpoint with key based authentication.

## Project Set Up and Installation
*OPTIONAL:* If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.

## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset
### Overview
The dataset contains detials of 299 patients - 105 women and 194 men - there are 13 features, which report clinical, body, and lifestyle information

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
