# Azure Nanodegree Capstone Project: Breast Cancer Prediction

My capstone project for the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree is to try to predict either a Mallign or a B result.

The objective is to train a machine learning model using Hyperdrive and AutoML and compare the results. Models from these two experiments are compared using Accuracy score, the best model is registered and deployed to Azure Container Service as a REST endpoint with key based authentication.

## Dataset

### Overview
The dataset used in this project is available from Kaggle 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset
contains detials of 299 patients - 105 women and 194 men - there are 13 features, which report clinical, body, and lifestyle information

### Task
The object of this project is to classify samples as either Malignant (M) or Benign (B).

### Access
The compressed dataset is available to download in Kaggle and i was able to add to my Github so that i can register it as a dataset in my Azure workspace in the Azure ML Studio GUI.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
